This is a basic API written in Flask for students who'd like to see some of the content we've learned in class utilized in a fun way!

To use, clone this repository to your machine. Different variations of the API exist, so try each one. A good place to start is to do this:

`python3 example1.py`

Navigate to `aux1` in your Alta3 LIVE environment. The endpoint `/data` will show all the quote data available in JSON format. `/quotes` will return a random quote from a random character.
